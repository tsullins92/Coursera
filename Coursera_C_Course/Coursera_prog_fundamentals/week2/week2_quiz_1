1. What is an lvalue?
A value that can be the left operant of an operator --- Apparently this is wrong

2. What does scope mean?
The region of code in which a variable is visible

3. With this code: int a = f(x,y);
Which of the following best describes how you determine what value to put in the box for a?
1. Create frame
2. Move execution arrow
3. return statement

4. If C did not have the keyword "for" but you wanted to write something where a for-loop were the natural choice, what could you use instead?
while

5.What is the difference between printing a value and returning a value?
Printing gives to user while returning gives to other code

6. For the following erroneous code:
int f (int x) { 
  int answer = 0        
  for (int i = 0; i < X; i++) {  
    answer += i * i;             
  }                              
  return answer;

What is the error on line 7?
missing }

7. Execute the following code by hand:
int main (void) {
  int a = 2;
  int b = 6;
  while (a <= b) {
    if (a % 2 == 1) {
      printf("a is %d\n", a);
    }
    else {
      printf("b is %d\n", b);
      for (int i = 0; i < b - a ; i++) {
        printf("a * i + b = %d\n", a * i + b);
      }
    }
    a++;
    b--;
  }
  return 0;
}
 
Which one of the following gives the correct output?

b is 6
a * i + b = 6
a * i + b = 8
a * i + b = 10
a * i + b = 12
a is 3
b is 4

8. Execute the following code by hand:
int anotherFunction(int a, int b) {
  int answer = 2;
  int x = 0;
  printf("In anotherFunction(%d,%d)\n",a,b);
  while (b > a) {
    printf("a is %d, b is %d\n", a, b);
    answer = answer + (b - a);
    b -= x;
    a += x / 2;
    x++;
  }
  return answer;
}

int someFunction(int x, int y) {
  int a = x + y;
  if (x < y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
      printf("In the loop with i = %d, a = %d\n", i, a);
      a = a + x;
    }
  }
  else {
    y = anotherFunction(y,a+1);
  }
  return a * (y-10);
}

int main(void) {
  int x = 2;
  int b = someFunction(3,x);
  printf("b = %d\n", b);
  printf("x = %d\n", x);
  return 0;
}

Which one of the following gives the correct output?

 In anotherFunction(2,6)
 a is 2, b is 6
 a is 2, b is 6
 a is 2, b is 5
 b = 15
 x = 2
