A key process in the simplerium system is logging in and creating a new property. To do this, a user will first click on the sign in button in the top right of the page, and supply their username and password. Once they are logged in, they will fill out the new property box with the name, address, and image of the property. The property will then be populated in the grid next to the new property box.
